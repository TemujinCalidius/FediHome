# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Micropub clients can now delete posts.** The Micropub endpoint handles `action=delete` (form-encoded and JSON), gated on the token's `delete` scope. Deleting a published post now federates an ActivityPub `Delete` to your followers (so Mastodon etc. drop their cached copy) and cleanly removes the post's replies/comments — previously the delete was JSON-only, unscoped, silent-on-failure, and left remote copies + could fail outright on posts that had comments. The XML-RPC `deletePost` path shares the same behaviour now. (#16)
- **A `/api/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring.** Returns the app version and a live database round-trip check (`200` when healthy, `503` when the DB is unreachable) — handy for uptime monitors and post-update smoke checks. Public and read-only. Ships alongside a small structured (JSON-line) logger for new server code. (#17)

### Changed
- Refreshed dependencies: `@fedify/fedify` & `@fedify/next` 2.3.0 → 2.3.1, `@atproto/api` 0.20.22 → 0.20.23, `nodemailer` 9.0.1 → 9.0.3, `tailwindcss` & `@tailwindcss/postcss` 4.3.1 → 4.3.2, `postcss` 8.5.15 → 8.5.16.

## 1.6.1 (2026-07-01)

### Changed
- Refreshed dependencies: `@fedify/fedify` & `@fedify/next` 2.2.5 → 2.3.0, `@atproto/api` 0.20.19 → 0.20.22, `@types/node` 26.0.0 → 26.0.1, `eslint` 10.5.0 → 10.6.0.

### Fixed
- **The timeline admin tab bar is reachable on narrow phones.** With seven tabs (feed…analytics) in one row, the trailing tabs were clipped off-screen on small viewports with no way to reach them. The row now scrolls horizontally. (#147)
- **No more phantom badge counts from likes/boosts on posts you don't own.** An incoming Fediverse `Like` or `Announce` was always recorded + pushed + counted toward the app badge, even when its target wasn't your content — but the notification bell only ever lists interactions on *your* posts, so the badge would climb with a push that had no matching bell entry (e.g. someone likes a post that's in your feed because you follow the booster). Incoming likes/boosts are now gated on an ownership check (`resolveOwnedTarget`, the same test the bell uses), so they only notify when they're genuinely on your content; the boosted-post-into-your-feed behaviour is unchanged. (#103)

## 1.6.0 (2026-06-27)

### Added
- **Bluesky interactions now reach your notification bell.** Likes, reposts, replies, mentions, quotes, and follows on your crossposted Bluesky posts are pulled in from Bluesky's notification feed (`listNotifications`) and shown in the bell alongside Fediverse activity — previously only the per-post reply poll ran (on page render), so likes/reposts were never recorded and nothing surfaced in the bell. Ingestion is incremental (resumes from a watermark), de-duplicated by each notification's own id (so a re-sync never double-counts), and the very first sync backfills history silently (no notification storm). The "Sync Bluesky" admin button and the scheduled Bluesky sync both run it. (#134)
- **Post pages show who liked and reposted on Bluesky, not just a count.** The interaction strip now renders the actual liker/reposter avatars from both Fediverse and Bluesky (source-tinted rings), using the per-actor data from the new Bluesky ingestion. (#135)

### Schema
- New `BlueskyInteraction` table holding per-actor Bluesky likes/reposts/mentions/quotes/follows on your posts (#134). Additive and non-destructive (a brand-new table). **After upgrading, run `npx prisma db push`** (or apply `prisma/manual-migrations/2026-06-25-bluesky-interaction.sql`).

## 1.5.1 (2026-06-25)

### Changed
- Bumped `@atproto/api` 0.20.16 → 0.20.19 (patch).

### Fixed
- **An incoming like or boost is no longer counted twice when redelivered.** The inbox recorded every incoming `Like` / `Announce` unconditionally — bumping the post's like/boost count, adding a notification, and firing a push — so a redelivered activity (federation retries / shared-inbox fan-out) double-counted, duplicated the bell entry, and re-notified. The matching `Undo` only decremented once, leaving a permanent residue on the count. Incoming likes/boosts are now de-duplicated per `(actor, post, type)`, so a redelivery is a no-op; a genuine re-like after an un-like still counts (the un-like removed the earlier record first). (#118)
- **`npm run update` no longer breaks on schema changes that add a unique constraint.** `update.sh` runs `prisma db push`, which refuses to add a unique index without `--accept-data-loss` (even a provably safe additive one) and bailed the whole upgrade. The updater now applies the idempotent `prisma/manual-migrations/*.sql` files (via `prisma db execute`) **before** `db push`, so a unique index can be pre-created and `db push` then sees no diff. Self-hosters don't need `--accept-data-loss`; the safety stance against genuine data loss is unchanged. (#124)

## 1.5.0 (2026-06-24)

### Added
- **Un-like and un-boost from the timeline.** The like and boost buttons are now toggles — clicking a lit one sends an `Undo(Like)` / `Undo(Announce)` to the post author's real inbox (resolved server-side, per #110) and clears the local state, so a mis-click is reversible. (#111)

### Security
- **Rate-limit keying now uses Cloudflare's authoritative client IP behind a trusted proxy.** With `TRUSTED_PROXY=true`, `rateLimitKey()` keyed on the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` hop — but Cloudflare *appends* to `X-Forwarded-For`, so that hop is client-supplied and spoofable, letting an attacker rotate it to evade the admin-login / guest-comment / XML-RPC / kudos rate limits. It now prefers `CF-Connecting-IP` (set by Cloudflare, not client-overridable), falling back to `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` for non-Cloudflare proxies. The default (`TRUSTED_PROXY` unset → one shared bucket) is unchanged. This makes it safe to enable `TRUSTED_PROXY` behind Cloudflare for genuine per-visitor limiting. (#109)

### Fixed
- **Likes, boosts, and replies now reach FediHome (and other non-Mastodon) servers.** Outbound delivery built the target inbox from Mastodon's convention `https://{domain}/users/{name}/inbox`, so it silently 404'd to FediHome (whose inbox is `/ap/inbox`) and any server with a different inbox path — meaning FediHome↔FediHome likes/boosts/replies never actually arrived. The inbox is now resolved server-side from the target actor's advertised/stored value — a cached follower/following record, else a live actor fetch — via a shared `resolveActorInbox()` helper; Mastodon targets are unaffected (they still resolve to their advertised `/users/<name>/inbox`). (#110)
- **Likes and boosts no longer double-deliver, inflating a follower's counts.** A `Like` was broadcast to all followers *and* sent to the post author, and a boost (`Announce`) was sent to followers *and* directly to the author — so a post author who also follows you received the activity twice, double-counting the like/boost (and the matching `Undo` only decremented once, leaving the count stuck). Likes now go only to the author (the standard target — they aren't broadcast to followers); boosts go to followers plus the author, but the direct author send is skipped when they already follow you (`deliverToFollowers` already reaches them). The same dedup applies to the `Undo` on un-like / un-boost. (#119)
- **A redelivered reply no longer shows up twice in notifications.** Incoming replies to your posts were recorded without a dedup guard, so when a federated server redelivered the same `Create(Note)` (retries / shared-inbox fan-out) you got a duplicate bell entry and a duplicate push. Replies are now de-duplicated on the reply's own ActivityPub id (a new `sourceApId` on the interaction record), so a redelivered reply is recognised and skipped — while genuinely distinct replies from the same person to the same post are still each kept. (#121)

### Schema
- `FediInteraction.sourceApId` — new nullable, **indexed** column holding the interacting activity's own apId (a reply Note's id), used to dedup redelivered replies (#121). Additive and non-destructive (existing rows get `NULL`). Deliberately **not** a unique constraint — `prisma db push` refuses to add a unique index without `--accept-data-loss`, so dedup is enforced in app code. **After upgrading, run `npx prisma db push`** (or apply `prisma/manual-migrations/2026-06-23-fediinteraction-sourceapid.sql`).

## 1.4.1 (2026-06-23)

**Fix release.** Hardens the kudos rate-limiter against a spoofable `X-Forwarded-For` (#93), and fixes the notification badge/bell desync — the badge now tracks the real unread count, boost counts decrement on un-boost, and like/boost notifications deep-link to the post (#103, partial). Backward-compatible — `npm run update`.

### Security
- **Kudos rate-limiting no longer trusts a spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`.** The guest "kudos" endpoint keyed its one-per-hour limit on the raw `X-Forwarded-For` header, so a scripted client could rotate it to inflate a post's kudos count without limit. It now uses the shared `rateLimitKey()` helper, which honours forwarded headers only when `TRUSTED_PROXY=true`; otherwise all requests share a single bucket per path (a spoofed header can't mint unlimited buckets). Per-visitor kudos therefore require a trusted reverse proxy. Also removed the now-unused `clientIp()` helper. (#93)

### Fixed
- **Notification badge stays in sync with the bell, boost counts decrement on un-boost, and like/boost notifications deep-link to the post.** Part of #103: (1) the app-icon badge now derives from the authoritative unread total (the same count the bell computes, extracted into a shared `computeNotifications()` and sent with every push) instead of a blind per-push `+1`, so it no longer climbs out of sync while the app is closed; (2) a new Undo-Announce handler decrements boost counts and removes the stored boost when a boost is retracted (previously boost rows only ever accumulated); (3) like/boost push notifications now open the relevant post instead of always `/timeline`. (The remaining parts of #103 — realigning the push gate to the bell and the inverse "silently-dropped reply" cases — are deferred to a dedicated change.) (#103)

## 1.4.0 (2026-06-22)

**Federation & maintenance release.** Shared posts now unfurl with a real preview card (image + summary) instead of a bare title+link, and the ActivityPub post object is unified across every publish path (#96); plus a five-major dependency refresh — TypeScript 6, marked 18, @atproto 0.20, @types/node 26, ESLint 10 (#100). Backward-compatible — upgrade with the usual `npm run update`.

### Changed
- **Dependency refresh — five major bumps, all backward-compatible.** TypeScript `5.9 → 6.0`, `marked` `17 → 18` (markdown→HTML output verified unchanged on representative posts), `@types/node` `25 → 26`, `@atproto/api` `0.19 → 0.20` (Bluesky SDK), and ESLint `9 → 10`, plus in-range patch/minor updates (Next 16.2.9, React 19.2.7, `pg`, `tailwindcss`, `fast-xml-parser`, `music-metadata`, `@fedify/next`). Verified with tsc / 77 tests / build / lint (0 errors) / `npm audit` (unchanged at 3 moderate — the parked postcss advisory). The ESLint 9→10 bump installs with peer warnings (`@next/eslint-plugin-next` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` still declare `eslint ^9`); lint runs clean regardless — to be tidied once those plugins ship eslint-10 peers.

### Fixed
- **Shared posts now unfurl with a real preview, and federate consistently across every publish path.** A titled post (Article) used to appear as a bare title + link on Mastodon and other servers — no description, no image. Two changes: (1) every post page now emits a complete Open Graph / Twitter card — a guaranteed preview image (cover → first photo → first inline image → audio cover → site default) and a clean, markdown-stripped description — so the link shows a picture and summary wherever it's posted (Mastodon's link card, Bluesky, Threads, Slack, Discord, …); (2) the ActivityPub post object is now built by one shared `buildPostObject()` used by the Micropub, XML-RPC, outbox, and per-post AP routes, so all paths federate identically — the Micropub/XML-RPC paths no longer send escaped raw markdown, titled Articles carry their `name`, and the cover image is attached (previously only inline photos were). (#96)

## 1.3.0 (2026-06-21)

**Features & hardening release.** Individually revocable admin sessions (#14), a "hide social graph" privacy opt-out (#23), and an optional "support the project" link (#64), plus rate-limit/dependency-advisory hardening (#10, #12, #55) and a large maintainability refactor that splits the 1,076-line `admin/route.ts` into per-domain modules (#11). Backward-compatible — upgrade with the usual `npm run update`. **One-time note:** this adds an `AdminSession` table and invalidates existing admin logins once, so sign in again after upgrading (see Schema below).

### Added
- **Optional "Support the project" link.** Set `FUNDING_URL` (e.g. your GitHub Sponsors / Ko-fi / Liberapay page) to show a themed `♥` link on the landing page (`LANDING_MODE`) and in the footer; `FUNDING_LABEL` customises the text (default "Support FediHome"). Unset → nothing renders, so other self-hosters see no change. Mirrors the existing config-driven webring/badge footer extras. (#64)
- **`HIDE_SOCIAL_GRAPH` privacy knob.** When set, `/ap/followers` and `/ap/following` still report their counts (`totalItems`) but no longer enumerate who follows you / who you follow — Mastodon's "hide social graph" behaviour. Off by default; federation delivery is unaffected (it only references the collection URIs, never their contents). (#23)
- **Revocable admin sessions.** Admin logins are now persisted server-side, so an individual session can be revoked without rotating `ADMIN_SECRET` (which logs *everyone* out). A new **/admin/sessions** page (linked from the timeline header) lists every signed-in device with its browser/OS and last-active time, and lets you revoke any one, "sign out all other sessions", or sign out the current device. Sessions also expire now — `ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` (default 30) bounds their lifetime. **On upgrade, existing admin logins are invalidated once** (the new session store starts empty), so you'll sign in again after deploying. (#14)

### Security
- **Cleared 4 of 5 outstanding transitive-dependency advisories** via npm `overrides`, forcing patched versions of `yaml`, `js-yaml`, `@opentelemetry/core`, and `@hono/node-server` (the last dev-only, via `@prisma/dev`). All were low-exposure moderates; verified with tsc / 70 tests / build / lint. The one remaining — `postcss` bundled *inside* Next.js (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) — has no upstream fix and is build-time / trusted-CSS only. (#12, #55)

### Changed
- **Restored `npm run lint` under Next 16** (which removed the `next lint` command): added ESLint 9 with a flat `eslint.config.mjs` wiring `@next/eslint-plugin-next`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v7 (React 19 "Rules of React"), and the TypeScript parser. The new render-purity/ref rules are surfaced as warnings for now. (#21)
- **Debug `console.log`s on the hot publish/federation paths are now silent by default.** Five informational logs (Micropub crosspost success, AP inbox activity received / unhandled type / DM received) are gated behind `FEDIHOME_DEBUG=true`; `console.error`/`console.warn` diagnostics are untouched. (#13)
- **Unified the rate-limit IP keying behind a single `rateLimitKey()` helper** (`src/lib/client-ip.ts`). The admin-login, XML-RPC, and guest-comment endpoints each carried their own byte-identical copy of the "trust `X-Forwarded-For` only when `TRUSTED_PROXY=true`, else one shared bucket" logic; they now share one tested helper, so the security invariant can't drift between routes. Behaviour is unchanged (the guest-comment hash now keys off `default` instead of `unknown` in the degenerate "proxy trusted but no forwarded header" case). (#10)
- **Split the 1,076-line `admin/route.ts` into per-domain action modules.** The single giant `switch (action)` POST handler is now a thin auth + dispatch layer (~55 lines) delegating to `_actions/{comments,replies,dms,fedi-graph,fedi-interactions,bluesky}.ts`. Pure refactor — every admin action (comment moderation, fedi/Bluesky replies, DMs, follow-graph, like/boost/block) behaves identically; verified by a per-action old-vs-new equivalence audit. (#11)

### Fixed
- **Post pages no longer re-poll Bluesky on every render.** Polling is now throttled by a per-post TTL and each network call has a timeout, so a slow or failing Bluesky never blocks page render; poll failures now log `err.cause` and the post URI instead of being swallowed. (#54)
- **Fixed two React 19 render-purity violations** surfaced by the restored lint: a ref written during render in the timeline (`TimelineClient`) now updates in an effect, and `NotificationBell` no longer calls `Date.now()` during render (relative times come from effect-backed state). (#78)
- **Cleared the one ESLint error** (`@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages`) on the setup wizard's completion screen — "Go to your site" is now a `next/link` `<Link>` (client transition instead of a full reload) — and removed two stale `eslint-disable` directives. (#83)
- **`install.sh` / `update.sh` run cleanly without a controlling terminal.** They no longer emit `/dev/tty: Device not configured` when run headlessly (the tty is now probed for openability before use), and they honour a non-interactive mode — set `FEDIHOME_NONINTERACTIVE=1` / `FEDIHOME_YES=1` / `CI=1` to skip prompts and take each one's stated default (destructive install prompts default to "no", so unattended runs are fail-closed). (#77)

### Schema
- New **`AdminSession`** table — persisted admin login sessions, enabling individual session revocation. Apply with `npx prisma db push` (the `update.sh` upgrade path runs this automatically). Existing admin logins are invalidated once on upgrade (the table starts empty), so sign in again afterwards. (#14)

## 1.2.0 (2026-06-20)

**Security & reliability release.** Clears a high-severity `nodemailer` advisory (#66) and adds the `assertPublicHost` SSRF guard to signed ActivityPub GETs (#67), migrates to the Next 16 `proxy` convention (#68), and hardens self-hosted installs/updates — configurable/safe PostgreSQL setup including PG15+ (#29, #31) and stale-build rebuilds (#63). Backward-compatible — upgrade with the usual `npm run update`.

### Security
- **Bumped `nodemailer` to v9** to clear GHSA-p6gq-j5cr-w38f (arbitrary file read / SSRF via the `raw` message option). FediHome doesn't use the `raw` option, so exposure was low, but it's a high-severity advisory on a direct dependency and the upgrade is drop-in. (#66)
- **`signedGet` now runs the `assertPublicHost` SSRF guard**, matching `signedFetch`. Every current caller already vets the URL, so this is defense-in-depth/consistency — a signed ActivityPub GET can no longer be coerced to a private/internal host even if a future caller forgets to check. (#67)

### Changed
- **Migrated the Next.js `middleware` convention to `proxy`** (Next 16 deprecated `middleware`). `src/middleware.ts` → `src/proxy.ts`, function renamed `middleware` → `proxy`; the matcher and behaviour (setup redirect + ActivityPub content negotiation) are unchanged. Clears the `next build` deprecation warning and stays ahead of the eventual removal. (#68)

### Fixed
- **`install.sh` is safer alongside an existing PostgreSQL, and works on PostgreSQL 15+.** The database name/role/host/port are now overridable (`DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` / `PGHOST` / `PGPORT`); the installer now **asks** before reusing an existing database or resetting an existing role's password (previously it reset silently); and it grants the app role ownership + `CREATE` on schema `public`, so `prisma db push` succeeds on PG15+ / non-owner setups where it used to fail with `permission denied for schema public`. Defaults are unchanged on a clean host. (#31, #29)
- **`npm run update` now rebuilds + restarts when the running build is stale, not only when there are commits to pull.** It records the last-built commit and, if HEAD differs from it (e.g. after switching branches) with nothing to pull, rebuilds and restarts the current code instead of exiting "already up to date" while the old build keeps serving. (#63)

## 1.1.0 (2026-06-19)

**Security & reliability release.** A hardening pass across the federation, XML-RPC, guest-comment, and setup paths, plus a configurable app port (`PORT` / `FEDIHOME_PORT`) and smoother self-hosted installs. Backward-compatible — upgrade with the usual `npm run update`, no action required. Validated live on the [fedihome.social](https://fedihome.social) demo before release.

### Security
- **Hardened the outbound federation path.** `signedFetch` (the signed ActivityPub delivery POST) now runs the same `assertPublicHost` SSRF guard the inbound/resolver paths use, so a delivery target can never be coerced to a private/internal host even if a caller forgets to vet it. Also fixed a tainted-format-string in delivery error logging (the inbox URL is now passed as a `%s` argument, not interpolated into the format string), and added least-privilege `permissions:` blocks to the CI workflows. Resolves CodeQL `js/request-forgery` (delivery), `js/tainted-format-string`, and `actions/missing-workflow-permissions`.
- **Hardened the XML-RPC (MetaWeblog) endpoint against ReDoS.** The hand-rolled regex value extraction backtracked polynomially on hostile input; it's been rewritten as a linear `indexOf` scan in a new, unit-tested `src/lib/xmlrpc.ts` module, and the endpoint now rejects oversized request bodies. Behaviour for real blogging clients is unchanged. Resolves the CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos` findings and the `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization` tag-strip in that file. Also clamps the `metaWeblog.getRecentPosts` page size to 1–50 and rejects non-finite values, so a crafted request can't trigger an unbounded query (or a `take: NaN` 500). (#9)
- **Robust plain-text snippets + an HTML-entity decode fix.** Notification and reply-preview snippets are now built by a shared `htmlToText` helper (`src/lib/html-text.ts`) that strips tags in a single linear pass, instead of one-shot regexes that nested or malformed tags could slip through; and `decodeHtmlEntities` (link-preview metadata) now decodes `&amp;` last, so a literal like `&amp;lt;` is no longer doubly-unescaped. These are plain-text sinks (so not XSS), but the old patterns were incorrect. Resolves the CodeQL `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization` and `js/double-escaping` findings in those paths.
- **The public guest-comment endpoint now caps the request body (64 KB → 413).** `POST /api/comments` parsed the body with no size limit (App Router routes don't inherit a `bodyParser` cap), so an unauthenticated caller could buffer a very large payload into memory before the field-length checks ran. Legitimate comments are far under the cap. (#8)
- **The first-run setup wizard now requires a one-time token.** On a fresh deploy that's publicly reachable before `ADMIN_SECRET` is set (manual/Docker installs), an anonymous visitor could previously POST `/api/setup` and claim admin. Completing setup now requires a `SETUP_TOKEN` — taken from the env var, or auto-generated once and printed to the server console — verified with a constant-time compare. It fails closed. `install.sh` installs already set `ADMIN_SECRET`, so they're unaffected. (#22)

### Fixed
- **The app listen port is now configurable.** The `dev`/`start` scripts hardcoded `--port 3000`, which overrode Next.js's built-in `PORT` support — so FediHome couldn't run on a host already using port 3000, and `PORT=…` was silently ignored. The flag is dropped (Next reads `PORT` natively), pm2 forwards `PORT`, and Docker Compose's host port is now `FEDIHOME_PORT`. All default to 3000, so existing deploys are unchanged. Remember to keep `SITE_URL` pointed at your real public origin if you change the port. (#27)
- **`npm run update` now restarts pm2 deployments under any process name, and fails loudly if it can't restart.** The updater only restarted a pm2 process literally named `fedihome`, so a differently-named pm2 app (common on multi-site hosts) or a bare `npm start` silently kept serving the old build while the script exited 0. It now finds the pm2 process by working directory (falling back to the `fedihome` name), and when nothing can be restarted it prints a clear error and exits non-zero instead of a green success banner. (#32)
- **`SITE_URL` is now persisted at setup, preserving protocol and port.** Neither `install.sh` nor the setup wizard wrote `SITE_URL` (the canonical origin for ActivityPub IDs, WebFinger, RSS, signature keyId, and the CSRF check), and the wizard's fallback dropped the port and forced `https`. The installer now prompts for it (defaulting to any existing value, so a re-run never clobbers), and the wizard records the browser origin. Off-3000 / proxied deploys no longer silently break federation. Pairs with #27. (#33)
- **The Docker image now builds and runs under Prisma 7.** Enabled Next.js `output: "standalone"` (the Dockerfile expected it but it was never configured, so `docker build` failed at the standalone copy); bundled the Prisma CLI's runtime deps (`@prisma/engines`, `@prisma/config`) into the runner so the startup `prisma db push` resolves them; and added a `.dockerignore` so host binaries can't leak into the Linux image. The `next start` / pm2 path is unaffected. (#40)

## 1.0.1 (2026-06-17)

### Fixed
- **Inbound federation now ingests `Create(Article)`, not just `Note`.** Titled posts (e.g. federated blog posts) from followed accounts were silently dropped on receipt and never reached the feed; the Article's title is now preserved as a heading. (#43)
- **`/ap/actor` now content-negotiates.** Browsers are redirected to the profile instead of receiving raw ActivityPub JSON; ActivityPub clients still get the actor JSON. (#44)

## 1.0.0 (2026-06-17)

**First stable release.** FediHome is a self-hosted, single-user Fediverse home — blog, photos, video, audio, and a live following feed, all on your own domain via ActivityPub. 1.0 marks the project production-ready: a test suite + CI gate every change, the security-audit findings are resolved, the dependency stack is current (Prisma 7, Next 16, Fedify 2), and a public demo runs the exact code at [fedihome.social](https://fedihome.social).

### Changed
- **Upgraded to Prisma 7** — driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) + the new `prisma-client` generator (client generated to `src/generated/` on install via `postinstall`). A connection/codegen change only; your data and schema are untouched. (#19)
- **`update.sh` / `install.sh` no longer pass the removed `--skip-generate` flag** to `prisma db push`, and `update.sh`'s Step-4 failure message no longer misattributes every error to data loss. (#39)

### Added
- **Continuous integration** — every PR and push to `main` runs typecheck + the Vitest suite (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **Config-gated public landing/showcase homepage** (`LANDING_MODE`) and a **read-only public Fediverse feed** (`PUBLIC_FEED`) — opt-in, off by default. (`src/components/home/LandingShowcase.tsx`, `src/app/fediverse/page.tsx`)
- **Configurable navigation visibility** (`NAV_SHOW_*`) and a **config-driven footer** (copyright / handle / email / webring all from config).
- **Vitest test suite** (sanitize, url-guard, auth) — the project's first automated tests.

### Security
- [P0] **Dependency CVE fixes** — `@fedify/fedify` → 2.2.5 (LD-Signature bypass), `tsx` → 4.22.4 (esbuild file-read), `nodemailer` → 8.0.11 (CRLF injection).
- [P1] **HTML sanitizer rewritten on `sanitize-html`** (tree-based parser) — closes known mXSS bypass vectors.
- [P1] **kudosLog memory leak** — TTL + hard-cap eviction on the in-memory rate-limit map.
- **Removed hardcoded personal data** from the public repo (footer, `security.txt`, media/audio/video metadata) — all now config-driven.

### Notes for upgraders
- **Prisma 7:** `npm run update` handles the upgrade, but `@prisma/adapter-pg` uses node-postgres, which reads `sslmode` differently from the old engine. If the DB won't connect after upgrading, append `?sslmode=disable` (SSL off) or `?sslmode=no-verify` (self-signed cert) to `DATABASE_URL`.
- The Prisma CLI now reads `.env.local` (via `prisma.config.ts`) — the old `.env` symlink workaround is no longer needed.
- **Docker:** a runner-stage dependency fix for Prisma 7 is pending (#40) — verify with `docker build` before deploying via container.

### Versioning
- First tagged release / GitHub Release; `package.json` is now `1.0.0`. Prior 0.x history is below.

## 0.9.0 (2026-06-16)

### Added
- **"View thread" now loads everyone's replies, not just ones you'd already seen.** It pulls the full conversation from the origin instance's Mastodon-API context endpoint (`/api/v1/statuses/:id/context` → ancestors + descendants), ingesting each reply locally (sanitised) so the whole thread renders — even replies from accounts you don't follow. Falls back to the signed-AP ancestor walk + local replies for non-Mastodon servers. Capped at 200 posts per view. (`src/app/api/conversation/route.ts`)
- **Like / boost a reply from within the thread view.** Each post in the conversation now has like and boost buttons (state seeded from the post so it persists). (`src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`)

## 0.8.1 (2026-06-15)

### Added
- **"Read article / Read more →" cue on post cards.** Article cards showed only the excerpt with no sign there was more to read. Cards now show a "Read article →" link for articles (and "Read more →" for posts with an excerpt or truncated body), so it's clear the whole card opens the full post. (`src/components/blog/PostCard.tsx`)

## 0.8.0 (2026-06-15)

### Added
- **One-click translate on each post.** A translate icon (next to share, bottom-right of each feed card) opens **Kagi Translate** with the post's text already filled in (target English, source auto-detected) — no more selecting text and right-clicking. Long posts translate the original page instead so nothing is truncated. (Kagi Translate is a paid Kagi feature; non-subscribers will hit Kagi's sign-in gate.) (`src/components/fedi/TranslateButton.tsx`, `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`)

## 0.7.0 (2026-06-15)

### Fixed
- **Like/boost no longer reset after a page reload.** The feed's like and boost buttons were driven by component state that always started "off" and was never persisted, so reloading lost the activated look. We now record the owner's like/boost on the post (`FediPost.likedByMe` / `boostedByMe`, set when the Like/Announce is sent) and initialise the buttons from it. (`prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/app/api/admin/route.ts`, `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`)

### Schema
- `FediPost.likedByMe` / `FediPost.boostedByMe` booleans. Apply with `npx prisma db push` (or `prisma/manual-migrations/2026-06-15-fedipost-reactions.sql`).

## 0.6.0 (2026-06-15)

### Fixed
- **Interaction counts ("Tap to load") were almost always blank, and "View thread" on a reply to someone else loaded no context.** Both were caused by **unsigned** ActivityPub GETs, which servers running Mastodon "authorized fetch" (secure mode — now the default) reject with 401. Added a signed-GET helper (`signedGet`, HTTP Signatures with the site actor key) and used it everywhere we read remote objects:
  - **Counts:** now read from the Mastodon REST API (`/api/v1/statuses/:id`, which publicly exposes favourites/reblogs/replies for the bulk of the fediverse — Mastodon/Pixelfed/GoToSocial/Pleroma), falling back to the **signed** AP object's collection totals. Mastodon doesn't expose like/boost totals over AP at all, which is why the old AP-only path came back empty. (`src/app/api/fedi-post-counts/route.ts`)
  - **View thread:** ancestor posts that aren't stored locally are now fetched with a **signed** GET, so the full reply chain above a "RE:" loads. Remote note content is also sanitised before storage (it's rendered as HTML). (`src/app/api/conversation/route.ts`)
  - (`src/lib/http-signatures.ts` — new `signedGet`.)

## 0.5.0 (2026-06-14)

### Fixed
- **RSS feed (`/feed.xml`) no longer looks broken for short notes, and now carries media.** Previously a titleless note repeated its (truncated, raw) text as both the `<title>` and `<description>`, and the feed included no photos/video/audio. Now:
  - Titleless notes get a **date + time title** (e.g. "14 June 2026, 3:23 pm") instead of duplicating the body.
  - The `<description>` carries the **full rendered HTML** (not a 280-char raw-markdown slice).
  - **Photos, video thumbnails/links, and audio links are embedded** (absolute URLs), plus a lead-image `<enclosure>` for thumbnail-style readers. (`src/app/feed.xml/route.ts`)

## 0.4.0 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **Share a post / copy its source link.** Each feed post card now has a share icon at its far bottom-right. On macOS/iOS (and Android) it opens the native share sheet via the Web Share API; elsewhere it copies the link with a brief "Copied!" confirmation. The shared URL is the post's **originating source** on its home server (a boost resolves to the original post's URL, not the local timeline). Posts with no canonical URL hide the icon. (`src/components/fedi/ShareButton.tsx`, `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`)

## 0.3.0 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **Live in-app updates (feed + notifications).** The timeline feed and the notification bell now refresh themselves instead of needing a manual reload — important for an always-open Dock/home-screen PWA:
  - **Push as the realtime signal** — when a Web Push arrives, the service worker pings any open window, which refreshes the feed and the bell **instantly** (no SSE/WebSocket, so it's proxy-safe).
  - **Focus + light polling backstop** — both also refresh the moment the app regains focus and poll every 30s while visible (paused while hidden).
  - **Non-disruptive feed updates** — at the top, new posts merge in seamlessly (prepend-only, never replacing loaded pages or rewinding the cursor); scrolled down, they're buffered behind a "↑ N new posts" pill so the reading position isn't yanked. Suppressed while composing an inline reply. (`src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`, `src/components/layout/NotificationBell.tsx`, `public/sw.js`)

## 0.2.3 (2026-06-14)

### Fixed
- **Test push no longer bumps the app-icon badge.** The "Send test" push was counting as 1 unread on the Dock/home-screen badge with no real notification to clear it against. The service worker now skips the badge for `type: "test"` pushes. (Existing stuck badges clear themselves the next time the app opens and re-syncs to the true unread count.) (`public/sw.js`)

## 0.2.2 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **App-icon notification badge.** The installed app (macOS Dock, or home screen elsewhere) now shows a number badge for unread notifications via the Web Badging API. The service worker sets/increments it when a push arrives — even while the app is closed (persisted in IndexedDB so it survives the worker being torn down) — and the open app keeps it synced to the true unread count, clearing it on "Mark all read". No-ops where the Badging API isn't supported. (`public/sw.js`, `src/components/layout/NotificationBell.tsx`)

## 0.2.1 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **Pull-to-refresh in the installed PWA.** Home-screen apps run in standalone mode, which disables the browser's native pull-to-refresh — this adds a custom one. Pull down from the top of any page and release to reload. Only active in standalone (a normal browser tab keeps its built-in gesture). (`src/components/ui/PullToRefresh.tsx`, mounted in the root layout.)

### Fixed
- **More mobile horizontal-drift fixes.** The `@mention` autocomplete dropdown is `position: fixed` (so it escapes the page's `overflow-x: clip`) and was positioned with stale scroll offsets + no right-edge clamp, letting it spill past the viewport and drift the page. It's now viewport-clamped (`max-w-[calc(100vw-1rem)]` + clamped `left`, no scroll offset). Added `overscroll-behavior-x: none` to `html, body` as an iOS belt-and-suspenders against horizontal rubber-band, and `break-words` to the compose result banner. (`src/components/ui/MentionAutocomplete.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/compose/ComposeClient.tsx`)

## 0.2.0 (2026-06-14)

### Added
- **Web Push / PWA notifications.** FediHome is now an installable home-screen app that delivers native push notifications for fediverse activity — **likes, boosts, replies, follows, DMs** — plus guest **comments**, even when the app is closed. Push is emitted from the AP inbox (`src/app/ap/inbox/route.ts`) and `src/app/api/comments/route.ts`, fanned out to every enrolled device via `sendPushToOwner` (`src/lib/push.ts`, web-push + VAPID). Dead endpoints are auto-pruned on 404/410. The feature is **dormant until you set VAPID keys** — generate them with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` and add `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` to `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).
- **Enrolment UI** in the admin-only notification bell (`src/components/layout/PushSetup.tsx`): "Enable phone notifications", a Test button, Turn-off, and iOS "Add to Home Screen" guidance (iOS 16.4+ only delivers push to a standalone home-screen install). Endpoints: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/push` (admin + CSRF) and `POST /api/push/test`.
- **PWA shell** — web manifest (`src/app/manifest.ts`, `display: standalone`, built from `siteConfig`), service worker (`public/sw.js`, push + tap-to-open), apple-touch-icon + `appleWebApp` + theme-color metadata in the root layout, and app icons generated from the site avatar (`public/icons/`).

### Fixed
- **Mobile: feed no longer drifts left/right while scrolling vertically.** Fedi post/reply/DM bodies render sanitised HTML that could contain long unbroken URLs or `@handle@domain` strings, pushing cards past the viewport. Added `break-words` to all four content containers (`src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`) and a document-level `overflow-x: clip` on both `html` and `body` plus `max-width: 100%` on media (`src/app/globals.css`). `clip` (not `hidden`) keeps the sticky navbar working.

### Schema
- New Prisma model **`PushSubscription`** (one row per enrolled browser/device). Apply with `npx prisma db push` (or `prisma/manual-migrations/2026-06-14-push-subscriptions.sql`).

## 0.1.20 (2026-06-06)

### Added
- **Back-to-top button** — a floating rounded button appears bottom-right once you scroll past ~400px on any page; clicking smooth-scrolls to the top. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Mounted once in the root layout so it covers the whole site. (`src/components/ui/ScrollToTop.tsx`)

## 0.1.19 (2026-05-10)

### Added
- **Edit existing posts** via the compose page (`?edit=<id>`). Admin Edit link on every post page jumps back into the compose form pre-filled with the original title, content, photos, video URLs, and audio attachments. Saving federates an ActivityPub `Update` activity so Mastodon shows &ldquo;edited X ago&rdquo;. Slug and AP id are preserved.
- **Edit existing fedi replies** inline. Outgoing fedi replies show an Edit affordance in timeline / post pages. Saving federates AP `Update`.
- **Symmetric reply crossposting** &mdash; inline fedi-comment replies can now also post to Bluesky (threaded under the local post&apos;s Bluesky version if it exists, standalone otherwise). Inline Bluesky-comment replies can now also federate to the Fediverse. Per-reply checkbox; auto-enabled when a cross-network mention is detected.
- **`@mention` autocomplete** in every compose / reply / edit textarea, drawing from `FediFollower` + `FediFollowing` AND `BlueskyFollower` + `BlueskyFollowing`. New endpoint `GET /api/mentions/search?q=...`. Auto-detected fedi mentions build AP `Mention` tags and direct-deliver to the mentioned actor&apos;s inbox.

### Known limitations
- Bluesky/Threads/DayOne crossposts are NOT re-published on edit (AT Protocol has no edit primitive).
- Auto-created Photo / Video / Audio records from &ldquo;Add to&hellip;&rdquo; toggles are not retroactively modified by editing &mdash; manage from their respective admin tabs.
- Editing Bluesky replies is hidden in v1 (delete + repost would lose existing likes/replies on Bluesky).

### Critical files
- `src/lib/mentions.ts` &mdash; new shared parser + AP tag/inbox helpers
- `src/app/api/mentions/search/route.ts` &mdash; new admin-only search endpoint
- `src/components/ui/MentionAutocomplete.tsx` &mdash; new hook + dropdown
- `src/components/fedi/EditReplyForm.tsx` &mdash; new inline-edit widget

## 0.1.18 (2026-05-19)

### Changed
- **Inline reply in the thread modal now prefills the recipient's `@user@domain` handle.** Previously, clicking **Reply** on a post inside the conversation modal opened an empty textbox, leaving you to wonder whether you needed to type the handle yourself. Now the input is pre-populated with the post author's handle followed by a space, so the cursor lands ready for the body of the reply. Replying to one of your own outgoing posts in the chain (`isOutgoing = true`) still opens empty — no point @-mentioning yourself.
- **Server `reply` action de-duplicates the leading mention.** The handler already prepends a proper `<span class="h-card">…</span>` mention to `contentHtml` and includes the `Mention` tag on the federated `Create`/`Note`. With the new prefill, the plain `content` would otherwise also carry a literal `@user@domain ` at the start, and recipients would see the handle twice. `case "reply"` in `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` now strips a leading copy of `mentionHandle` from the incoming `content` (whitespace-tolerant) before building `linkedContent`, and stores the stripped `bodyText` on the locally-persisted `FediPost` row so the canonical mention HTML stays the single source of truth.

### Files
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — `FediPostItem` gains optional `isOutgoing?: boolean` (the field already comes back from `/api/conversation`, it just wasn't declared on the client). The Reply button's `onClick` in `ThreadView` switches from `setReplyContent("")` to a conditional prefill.
- `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` — `case "reply"` adds an 8-line strip block before the URL auto-link regex; the `prisma.fediPost.upsert` `create` block now writes `content: bodyText` instead of `content: replyContent`.

### Notes for upgraders
- No schema changes, no env changes, no upgrade steps beyond `git pull && npm run build && pm2 restart fedihome` (or your usual process). Threading (`inReplyTo`), inbox delivery, and follower fan-out are unchanged — only the textbox UX and the dedup on the way out.

## 0.1.17 (2026-05-18)

### Added
- **"Replies" tab in the admin Timeline.** A new top-level tab between **Feed** and **Messages** lists every reply you've sent to someone else's post — outgoing `FediPost` rows where `isOutgoing = true` and `inReplyTo` is set. Each row shows a quoted parent line (`@user@domain` plus a 160-char snippet from the parent's content if cached locally, or an italic "Replying to a post not cached locally — open the thread to fetch it." fallback), the body of your reply, and a **View thread** button that opens the existing conversation modal so you can see the full ancestor chain plus sibling replies. Paginated 25 at a time (`publishedAt` cursor). Reuses the existing `/api/conversation` thread walker — no new threading code.
- **Like / repost / reply counts on others' posts in the feed.** A small `💬 / 🔁 / ❤` strip below each `PostCard` shows interaction counts pulled on demand from the remote ActivityPub object (the `replies`, `shares`, `likes` collections — Mastodon, Pleroma, and Misskey all expose these in some form). Until you tap, the strip shows "💬 🔁 ❤ Tap to load" so the feed scroll stays fast and we don't hammer remote servers. Clicking **View thread** auto-triggers the same fetch as a side effect. Counts are cached on the `FediPost` row for 5 minutes; re-tapping within that window returns the cached values without a network call. Each post inside the conversation modal also gets its own counts strip + Reply box, so you can jump into a chain at any depth.
- **"View thread" now works on every post,** not just replies. The existing `/api/conversation` endpoint already walks both directions (ancestors via `inReplyTo`, descendants via reply lookup), so calling it for a top-level post returns the same shape — the modal handles either case naturally.

### Schema
- New nullable columns on `FediPost`: `likeCount Int?`, `boostCount Int?`, `replyCount Int?`, `countsFetchedAt DateTime?`. All NULL means "never fetched"; NULL after a fetch means the remote hides that collection (Mastodon's authenticated-fetch quirk). Apply with `npx prisma db push`.

### Files
- New `src/app/api/replies/route.ts` — `GET /api/replies?cursor=<ISO>` returns the admin's outgoing replies, latest first, with a `parent` summary attached per row when the parent post is in our local cache. Reuses the existing `@@index([inReplyTo])` and `verifyAdmin()` gate.
- New `src/app/api/fedi-post-counts/route.ts` — `POST /api/fedi-post-counts { postId }` fetches the remote AP object, reads `totalItems` off each collection (handles both inline OrderedCollection and URL-referenced forms), persists `likeCount`/`boostCount`/`replyCount`/`countsFetchedAt`, and returns the result. SSRF-guarded via `assertPublicHost()` (`src/lib/url-guard.ts`), 8s per outbound fetch, 5-minute cache TTL on the row.
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — adds `RepliesTab`, `ThreadCountsStrip`, and `fmtCount` components. `PostCard` and `ThreadView` gain `counts` + `onLoadCounts` props. New top-level state: `postCounts` (Map<postId, FediCountsState>), `replies`, `repliesCursor`, `repliesLoading`. `handleLoadCounts` does the optimistic-update + POST dance.

### Notes for upgraders
- Run `npx prisma db push` before restarting the server so the four new `FediPost` columns exist; otherwise `/api/replies` and `/api/fedi-post-counts` will 500.
- Counts populate lazily — old posts in your feed will show "Tap to load" until you click. There is no backfill cron; that's intentional, both to stay polite to remote servers and so counts are fresh when you actually look.
- Existing `PostCard` and `ThreadView` call sites in `TimelineClient` need the new `counts` + `onLoadCounts` props if you've forked the file.

## 0.1.15 (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **"+ New message" compose flow in the admin Timeline DMs tab.** A modal (`NewMessageModal` in `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`) lets you start a brand-new conversation without first receiving an inbound DM. Three picker tabs: **Following** and **Followers** (both merged Fedi + Bluesky lists, searchable by name/handle/domain), and **Other** (free-text input — Fediverse `user@domain.tld` or Bluesky `name.bsky.social`). Selecting a contact opens a textarea; on send the modal POSTs to `/api/admin` and the page reloads to show the sent message in the conversation thread.
- **"Mark all read" button** in the conversations list header. Disabled when nothing is unread; bulk-upserts a `lastReadAt = now` row for every conversation key currently in `DirectMessage`.
- **Outgoing-DM delivery audit.** `DirectMessage` gains nullable `deliveredAt` (set when the remote inbox returned 2xx for Fedi, or when `chat.bsky.convo.sendMessage` returned success for Bluesky) and `deliveryError` (the HTTP status + truncated body, or the network error message). Thread view (`MessagesTab`) renders a green ✓ next to delivered outgoing messages with a tooltip showing the timestamp, a red ✗ for failures with the error in the tooltip, or a grey · for messages stored before this release.
- **Two new admin actions for the new compose flow.** `dm_new_fedi` accepts `recipientUri` (already-known Fediverse actor) or `recipientHandle` (free-text — resolves via WebFinger). `bsky_dm_new` accepts `recipientDid` or `recipientHandle` and calls `chat.bsky.convo.getConvoForMembers` to start (or fetch) the conversation before posting the first message. Both share the same delivery-audit code path as the reply actions.
- **Two new admin actions for read tracking.** `mark_dm_read` upserts a single `DmConversationRead` row; `mark_all_dms_read` runs a `prisma.$transaction` of upserts across every distinct `conversationKey` in `DirectMessage`.

### Changed
- **DM read state moved from browser localStorage to the database.** Previously `MessagesTab` tracked unread/read with a `dm-read-timestamps` localStorage key, which meant clearing site data or opening on a different device made already-read conversations look unread again. Read state now lives in a new `DmConversationRead` table (one row per `conversationKey`), loaded into `TimelineClient` via the new `dmReadState` prop on `src/app/timeline/page.tsx`. The unread-count badge on the **messages** tab reads from the same state, so it stays consistent. Mark-read is optimistic — the UI updates instantly and the POST happens in the background.
- **Fediverse DM recipient inbox is now resolved properly.** The previous `dm_reply` handler fell back to `${recipientUri}/inbox` when no inbox was passed in — fine for Mastodon but unreliable elsewhere. Both `dm_reply` and `dm_new_fedi` now consult `FediFollower` / `FediFollowing` first (already-vetted inbox) and only fall back to a live actor fetch if the URI isn't cached.
- **`deliverActivity()` (`src/lib/http-signatures.ts`) now returns `DeliveryResult` instead of `void`.** Previously it logged failures to console and returned nothing; callers had no way to surface delivery status to the user. The new `{ ok, status, error? }` return is what powers the new `deliveredAt` / `deliveryError` audit fields. Existing callers (boost / like / follow-accept / federate-comment / federate-reply / shared-inbox fan-out) still `await` and ignore the return — behaviour is unchanged for them.

### Schema
- New nullable columns `deliveredAt` (`DateTime?`) and `deliveryError` (`String?`) on `DirectMessage`. Existing rows get NULL, which the UI renders as the grey · "delivery status unknown" indicator.
- New table `DmConversationRead { conversationKey @id, lastReadAt, updatedAt @updatedAt }`. Apply with `npx prisma db push`.

### Files
- New `src/lib/fedi-resolve.ts` — `resolveFediActorByHandle()` runs WebFinger then fetches the actor JSON; `resolveFediActorByUri()` skips WebFinger when the actor URI is already known. Both are SSRF-guarded via `assertPublicHost()` and 10s-timeouted. Returns `{ actorUri, inbox, sharedInbox, username, domain, displayName, avatarUrl }` or null.
- `src/lib/http-signatures.ts` — `deliverActivity()` returns `DeliveryResult`; the success / error branches both go through the same return path so callers can capture status without try/catch.
- `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` — two helpers (`resolveFediRecipient`, `sendFediDm`) shared by `dm_reply` and `dm_new_fedi`. The `bsky_dm_reply` and `bsky_dm_new` cases share a single switch arm; `bsky_dm_new` uses `getConvoForMembers` to bootstrap the convo before sending. `mark_dm_read` and `mark_all_dms_read` are thin upsert handlers.
- `src/app/timeline/page.tsx` — loads `DmConversationRead` rows alongside `DirectMessage` and passes a `dmReadState: Record<conversationKey, ISO timestamp>` prop to `TimelineClient`.
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — `MessagesTab` is now a controlled component (read state + handlers passed in). New `NewMessageModal` component holds the picker + compose UI. `DirectMessageItem` interface gains `deliveredAt` and `deliveryError`. The localStorage helpers (`READ_TIMESTAMPS_KEY`, `getReadTimestamps`, `markConversationRead`) are removed; the unread-count tab badge now uses the same `buildConversations()` helper as the tab body so the two can't drift.

### Notes for upgraders
- Run `npx prisma db push` before restarting the server, otherwise the timeline page will 500 on the new `DmConversationRead` query.
- Existing localStorage read state is dropped — on first load after the upgrade, all conversations look unread until the user clicks into them or hits **Mark all read**. There is no migration of prior client-side state to the server (it would have been per-browser and incomplete).

## 0.1.14 (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **Unified Bluesky + Fediverse followers/following in the admin Timeline.** The header counts beside the **+ Compose** button (`src/app/timeline/page.tsx`) now show the combined total across both networks. The **Followers** and **Following** tabs render a single merged list sorted by `createdAt` desc, with a small `bsky` pill on Bluesky rows; profile links route to `https://bsky.app/profile/{handle}` for Bluesky entries. Each tab gains a **Sync Bluesky** button that pulls the live graph from the AT Protocol (`getFollowers` + `getFollows`, paginated 100/page) and reconciles it into the local DB — rows whose DID is not seen during sync are deleted so unfollows propagate. **Follow Back** on a Bluesky follower not yet in the following list creates a real `app.bsky.graph.follow` record. **Unfollow** on a Bluesky following row calls `agent.deleteFollow()` against the stored follow-record URI. The Follow form in the Following tab now accepts either a Fediverse handle (`@user@domain`) or a Bluesky handle/DID (`name.bsky.social`, `did:plc:...`) — handler classifies via a `@user@host.tld` regex and routes to the right backend action. Empty-state copy in the Followers tab now uses `siteConfig.fediAddress` instead of a hardcoded handle (a stray personal handle had been carried over in past releases; sanitized in this release).
- **Daily scheduled Bluesky sync.** New `scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` runs `syncBlueskyGraph()` and `pollBlueskyDMs()` once and exits. Intended to be wired up as a PM2 cron entry — script header documents the `pm2 start ... --cron-restart "0 3 * * *" --no-autorestart` invocation — or via system crontab. Manual one-shot: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts`. Not auto-installed; operators run the `pm2 start` command once on the host (then `pm2 save`).

### Fixed
- **Bluesky chat (DM) endpoints now use the required proxy header.** `pollBlueskyDMs()` (`src/lib/bluesky-dm-poll.ts`) and the `bsky_dm_reply` admin action (`src/app/api/admin/route.ts`) were calling `agent.api.chat.bsky.convo.*` against `bsky.social` directly, which returns HTTP 501 `MethodNotImplemented`. Both now route via `agent.withProxy("bsky_chat", "did:web:api.bsky.chat")`. Without this, the manual "Poll Bluesky" button and outgoing Bluesky DM replies were silently broken — verified by reproducing the 501 from a standalone runner. The same fix lets `scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` actually pull DMs.

### Schema
- Two new Prisma models: `BlueskyFollower` and `BlueskyFollowing` (the latter carries a nullable `followUri` for the AT URI of our follow record, required to call `deleteFollow`). Apply with `npx prisma db push`. Existing tables are untouched.

### Files
- New `src/lib/bluesky-graph.ts` — `syncBlueskyGraph()` paginates `getFollowers` / `getFollows` and reconciles the local mirrors with prune-on-miss; `followBlueskyAccount()` / `unfollowBlueskyAccount()` create and undo follow records, persisting the AT URI returned from `agent.follow()`; `resolveBlueskyActor()` turns a handle (or DID) into a DID via `agent.resolveHandle`.
- New `scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` — standalone tsx script for cron use.
- `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` — three new actions: `sync_bluesky_graph`, `bsky_follow` (accepts `did` or `handleOrDid`), `bsky_unfollow` (by local `followingId`, returns 422 if the row lacks `followUri`). DM-reply proxy header fix in the `bsky_dm_reply` branch.
- `src/lib/bluesky-dm-poll.ts` — chat-service proxy header on `listConvos` / `getMessages`.
- `src/app/timeline/page.tsx` — loads `blueskyFollower` / `blueskyFollowing` alongside the Fedi tables, builds discriminated-union merged arrays sorted by `createdAt` desc, derives `totalFollowerCount` / `totalFollowingCount` for the header, and passes `siteConfig.fediAddress` through to the client.
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — `FollowerItem` / `FollowingItem` are now `{ source: "fedi" } | { source: "bsky" }` unions; both tab renderers branch on `source` for the identity row, profile link, Follow Back / Unfollow targets, and Sync Bluesky button. The Follow form's submit handler detects `@user@domain` via regex and falls back to `bsky_follow` otherwise. Accepts a new `fediAddress` prop used in the empty-state copy.

## 0.1.13 (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **New installs would never create database tables.** `install.sh`, the Dockerfile, the README, and the deployment docs all ran `npx prisma migrate deploy` — but FediHome doesn't track migration files (no `prisma/migrations/` directory). With nothing to deploy, `migrate deploy` exited cleanly without creating any tables, so a fresh `curl install.sh | bash` produced an app that crashed the moment it tried to query Postgres. Verified with the actual Prisma CLI: against an empty `prisma/migrations/` it prints *"No migration found in prisma/migrations / No pending migrations to apply"* and creates zero tables.
- Switched `install.sh`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the relevant `docs/*.md` to `npx prisma db push`, which is what the project's no-migrations workflow actually requires. `db push` reads `prisma/schema.prisma` directly and creates/updates tables to match. Prisma refuses any push that would drop data unless you pass `--accept-data-loss`, so it's also safe to run on existing production databases when upgrading.
- **Dockerfile**: container now runs `npx prisma db push --skip-generate` at startup before launching the server, so the schema is synced against whatever database `DATABASE_URL` points at — first install or upgrade. The Prisma CLI is now copied into the runner stage (was builder-only) for this purpose.

### Notes for upgraders
- Existing operators don't need to do anything — your DB already has the tables. Future `git pull && npx prisma db push && npm run build && pm2 restart fedihome` upgrade flow remains unchanged.
- Contributors changing `prisma/schema.prisma`: run `npx prisma db push` (no `migrate dev`) and document the change under a "Schema" heading in the changelog.

## 0.1.12 (2026-05-11)

### Added
- **Author follow-ups on microblog posts.** From your own post detail page, an admin-only "Add follow-up" button lets you compose a threaded reply that cross-posts to Bluesky as a real reply (uses `reply.root` and `reply.parent` against the original's stored AT URI, with thread-root resolution if the parent is itself a reply) and federates as an ActivityPub Note with `inReplyTo` set to the parent's `apId`. Follow-ups become first-class `Post` rows with their own slug, permalink, and federation, but are hidden from the homepage feed, journal, articles, RSS, XML-RPC, and profile post counts — they appear inline on the original post's page as author-styled comment cards (uses `siteConfig.authorName` and `siteConfig.avatarPath`) with a "View follow-up thread →" link, and a "↩ in reply to [original]" header at the top of any follow-up's permalink. Threads/DayOne are skipped for follow-ups (no useful threading model). Replies-to-incoming-comments still stay platform-local (existing behavior unchanged). UI is gated to top-level posts in v1; the data model already supports chained follow-ups.

### Schema
- New self-referential FK on `Post`: `inReplyToPostId` (nullable) → `Post.id`, with reverse relations `inReplyTo` / `followUps` and an index on `inReplyToPostId`. Apply with `npx prisma db push`. Existing rows get `NULL`.

### Files
- New `src/lib/crosspost.ts:crosspostReplyToBluesky()` — resolves the parent CID via `agent.getPost`, walks up to the thread root if the parent is itself a reply, then calls `agent.post` with the proper `reply.root` / `reply.parent` refs. Shares text-truncation / embed-building with the existing `crosspostToBluesky` (extracted into a private `truncateForBluesky` helper).
- New `src/components/fedi/AuthorFollowUpForm.tsx` — small client form (textarea + 300-char counter + submit) that POSTs `{ content, inReplyToPostId }` to `/api/compose` and refreshes on success.
- `src/app/api/compose/route.ts` — accepts optional `inReplyToPostId`; routes Bluesky to the threaded helper when the parent has a `blueskyUri`; sets `inReplyTo: parent.apId` on the federated AP `Create` activity; gates Threads/DayOne to top-level only.
- `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` — fetches `followUps` and `inReplyTo`; renders follow-ups inline; renders the in-reply-to header; mounts the form when `isAdmin && !post.inReplyToPostId`.
- `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/journal/page.tsx`, `src/app/articles/page.tsx`, `src/app/feed.xml/route.ts`, `src/app/users/[username]/page.tsx`, `src/app/xmlrpc/route.ts` — listing queries filtered with `inReplyToPostId: null` so follow-ups don't clutter feeds.
- `src/app/ap/outbox/route.ts`, `src/app/ap/post/[slug]/route.ts` — emit `inReplyTo` in the AP object so other servers thread follow-ups correctly.

## 0.1.11 (2026-05-10)

### Security
This release applies the cross-portable findings from a deep security audit run against the sister project samuellison-web on 2026-05-10. (Findings tagged H4/H6/C4/C5/H7 from the previous fedihome audit were already fixed.)

#### Critical
- **AP inbox SSRF.** `verifyIncomingSignature`, `fetchActorInfo`, and `handleBoost`'s remote-post fetch now reject URLs whose hostname is in private/loopback/CGNAT/link-local space — and additionally DNS-resolve to defeat rebinding. New `src/lib/url-guard.ts` exports `isPrivateUrl` (public, with decimal/hex/octal IPv4 + IPv6 ULA + link-local + v4-mapped) and an async `assertPublicHost` for trust-boundary fetches.
- **HTML sanitizer entity bypass.** `src/lib/sanitize.ts` now decodes HTML entities before checking dangerous URI schemes, so `&#x6a;avascript:alert(1)` no longer slips through to federated content rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Also strips `<iframe>` and catches self-closing `<script/>`/`<style/>`.

#### High
- **`image/svg+xml` removed** from the `/uploads/[...path]` MIME map. The route no longer serves uploaded SVGs (XSS-prone when navigated directly).
- **CSP hardening.** Dropped `'unsafe-eval'` from `script-src`. Added `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `object-src 'none'`/`base-uri 'self'`/`form-action 'self'`. New per-route `/uploads/*` header (`default-src 'none'; sandbox`) so any payload that slips media validation can't execute scripts.
- **XML-RPC brute force.** `/xmlrpc` no longer accepts `ADMIN_SECRET` as the password — Micropub bearer tokens only — and is now per-bucket rate-limited (10 attempts / 60s, same `TRUSTED_PROXY` model as the admin login route).

#### Medium
- **CSRF on guest endpoints.** `verifyOrigin` is now applied to `/api/comments` and `/api/kudos`.
- **Bluesky thumbnail fetch SSRF.** `crosspostToBluesky`'s video link-card path rejects private/internal `thumbnailUrl`s and adds a 10s timeout.
- **XML-RPC content & XML injection.** Post titles and IDs are XML-escaped on output; CDATA-wrapped content has internal `]]>` split to prevent CDATA termination.
- **`verifyOrigin` protocol check.** Validates protocol in addition to hostname.

#### Low / hygiene
- `<script>`/`<style>` strip regex extended to catch self-closing variants.
- Middleware uses `pathname.slice` instead of `pathname.replace`.
- Removed unused `isAdminRequest` helper from `src/lib/auth.ts`.
- Added `/.well-known/security.txt` template (replace email before deploying).

### Notes for forks
- This release does **not** introduce the DB-backed session-token model from samuellison-web. FediHome's existing per-login HMAC-bound cookie (added in a prior release) is functionally equivalent for the H4 finding. Operators wanting the DB-session approach should adapt from samuellison-web v0.4.0.

## 0.1.10 (2026-05-10)

### Fixed
- **Bluesky video crossposts** now render as a tappable rich link card instead of a broken/missing preview. PeerTube/MakerTube thumbnails are fetched, uploaded as a blob, and attached as `app.bsky.embed.external` (uri + title + description + thumb). Posts with photos still use the existing `app.bsky.embed.images` path; posts with both photos and a video keep the photos embed and append the video URL inline. Threads/DayOne crossposts unchanged.
- **Mobile menu drift** — `MobileMenu.tsx` was missing "Videos" and "Audio" entries (added in 0.1.9 to the desktop navbar) and still listed a stale "Store" item that never existed in FediHome. Both menus now read from a shared `src/lib/nav.ts` config to prevent future drift.

### Changed
- Home page intro now also links to Videos and Audio (in addition to About Me and Photography). Row uses `flex-wrap` so it tidies on mobile.

## 0.1.9 (2026-05-09)

### Added
- **Video section** at `/videos` — embed PeerTube videos in posts. Paste a URL in compose, the system fetches title + thumbnail via PeerTube oEmbed. Federation includes the video URL so Mastodon shows a link preview. Allowlist of trusted PeerTube hosts (makertube.net, framatube.org, tilvids.com, etc.) — extend in `src/lib/peertube.ts`.
- **Audio section** at `/audio` — upload MP3s with automatic duration detection. Native HTML5 audio player. Dedicated `/audio/[slug]` page. Hero slider for featured tracks.
- **Podcast RSS feed** at `/audio/feed.xml` — RSS 2.0 + iTunes namespace, ready for any podcast app. Configure title/author/cover via `PODCAST_TITLE`, `PODCAST_AUTHOR`, `PODCAST_DESCRIPTION`, `PODCAST_EMAIL`, `PODCAST_IMAGE` env vars.
- **Compose post types** — `+ Add video` (URL modal with oEmbed preview) and `+ Add audio` (MP3 upload, max 100MB). "Add to Videos" and "Add to Audio" toggles.
- **HTTP Range request support** in the `/uploads/[...path]` route — needed for audio scrubbing.
- ActivityPub federation: outgoing posts with audio attach a `Document` with `mediaType: audio/mpeg`; posts with videos include the URL in content.

### Schema
- New `Video` model
- New `Audio` model
- `Post` extended with `videos[]`, `videoTitles[]`, `audioPaths[]`, `audioTitles[]`, `audioCovers[]` arrays

### New dependencies
- `music-metadata` — reads MP3 duration without needing ffmpeg

### Other
- Navbar gains "Videos" and "Audio" links

## 0.1.8 (2026-05-09)

### Security
- Fix HIGH severity Fedify CVE [GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp) — resource exhaustion via unbounded HTTP redirects (Fedify 2.0.6 → 2.2.0)

### Added
- **Service update monitor** — `npm run check-updates` script reads `npm outdated`, `npm audit`, and GitHub release feeds for a curated watchlist (Fedify, Next.js, Prisma, atproto, React); findings appear in the notification bell under a new "Updates" category with dismiss/apply actions
- **Hero slider** on `/photography` — opt-in via `Photo.hero` flag (disabled by default); 16:7 auto-advancing carousel with dot + arrow + swipe nav, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **`MaintenanceItem` model** + key-value `SiteSetting` model already added in 0.1.7 now powers maintenance read state
- **Photo dimension columns** (`width`, `height`) backfilled via `sharp` — required for masonry layout
- **Lightbox bottom action bar** — optional "View post" link surfaces detail-page comments/EXIF without forcing a full nav

### Changed
- **Photography grid switched from forced 1:1 uniform crop to true masonry** via `react-masonry-css` — portraits stay portrait, landscapes stay landscape, mixed orientations render at native aspect ratio
- Photo click now opens a fullscreen Lightbox with arrow/keyboard/swipe nav across the entire portfolio (no longer routes to the blog post)
- Notification API includes maintenance items as a new `update` type with wrench icon and amber accent
