# Changelog

## 0.1.15 (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **"+ New message" compose flow in the admin Timeline DMs tab.** A modal (`NewMessageModal` in `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx`) lets you start a brand-new conversation without first receiving an inbound DM. Three picker tabs: **Following** and **Followers** (both merged Fedi + Bluesky lists, searchable by name/handle/domain), and **Other** (free-text input — Fediverse `user@domain.tld` or Bluesky `name.bsky.social`). Selecting a contact opens a textarea; on send the modal POSTs to `/api/admin` and the page reloads to show the sent message in the conversation thread.
- **"Mark all read" button** in the conversations list header. Disabled when nothing is unread; bulk-upserts a `lastReadAt = now` row for every conversation key currently in `DirectMessage`.
- **Outgoing-DM delivery audit.** `DirectMessage` gains nullable `deliveredAt` (set when the remote inbox returned 2xx for Fedi, or when `chat.bsky.convo.sendMessage` returned success for Bluesky) and `deliveryError` (the HTTP status + truncated body, or the network error message). Thread view (`MessagesTab`) renders a green ✓ next to delivered outgoing messages with a tooltip showing the timestamp, a red ✗ for failures with the error in the tooltip, or a grey · for messages stored before this release.
- **Two new admin actions for the new compose flow.** `dm_new_fedi` accepts `recipientUri` (already-known Fediverse actor) or `recipientHandle` (free-text — resolves via WebFinger). `bsky_dm_new` accepts `recipientDid` or `recipientHandle` and calls `chat.bsky.convo.getConvoForMembers` to start (or fetch) the conversation before posting the first message. Both share the same delivery-audit code path as the reply actions.
- **Two new admin actions for read tracking.** `mark_dm_read` upserts a single `DmConversationRead` row; `mark_all_dms_read` runs a `prisma.$transaction` of upserts across every distinct `conversationKey` in `DirectMessage`.

### Changed
- **DM read state moved from browser localStorage to the database.** Previously `MessagesTab` tracked unread/read with a `dm-read-timestamps` localStorage key, which meant clearing site data or opening on a different device made already-read conversations look unread again. Read state now lives in a new `DmConversationRead` table (one row per `conversationKey`), loaded into `TimelineClient` via the new `dmReadState` prop on `src/app/timeline/page.tsx`. The unread-count badge on the **messages** tab reads from the same state, so it stays consistent. Mark-read is optimistic — the UI updates instantly and the POST happens in the background.
- **Fediverse DM recipient inbox is now resolved properly.** The previous `dm_reply` handler fell back to `${recipientUri}/inbox` when no inbox was passed in — fine for Mastodon but unreliable elsewhere. Both `dm_reply` and `dm_new_fedi` now consult `FediFollower` / `FediFollowing` first (already-vetted inbox) and only fall back to a live actor fetch if the URI isn't cached.
- **`deliverActivity()` (`src/lib/http-signatures.ts`) now returns `DeliveryResult` instead of `void`.** Previously it logged failures to console and returned nothing; callers had no way to surface delivery status to the user. The new `{ ok, status, error? }` return is what powers the new `deliveredAt` / `deliveryError` audit fields. Existing callers (boost / like / follow-accept / federate-comment / federate-reply / shared-inbox fan-out) still `await` and ignore the return — behaviour is unchanged for them.

### Schema
- New nullable columns `deliveredAt` (`DateTime?`) and `deliveryError` (`String?`) on `DirectMessage`. Existing rows get NULL, which the UI renders as the grey · "delivery status unknown" indicator.
- New table `DmConversationRead { conversationKey @id, lastReadAt, updatedAt @updatedAt }`. Apply with `npx prisma db push`.

### Files
- New `src/lib/fedi-resolve.ts` — `resolveFediActorByHandle()` runs WebFinger then fetches the actor JSON; `resolveFediActorByUri()` skips WebFinger when the actor URI is already known. Both are SSRF-guarded via `assertPublicHost()` and 10s-timeouted. Returns `{ actorUri, inbox, sharedInbox, username, domain, displayName, avatarUrl }` or null.
- `src/lib/http-signatures.ts` — `deliverActivity()` returns `DeliveryResult`; the success / error branches both go through the same return path so callers can capture status without try/catch.
- `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` — two helpers (`resolveFediRecipient`, `sendFediDm`) shared by `dm_reply` and `dm_new_fedi`. The `bsky_dm_reply` and `bsky_dm_new` cases share a single switch arm; `bsky_dm_new` uses `getConvoForMembers` to bootstrap the convo before sending. `mark_dm_read` and `mark_all_dms_read` are thin upsert handlers.
- `src/app/timeline/page.tsx` — loads `DmConversationRead` rows alongside `DirectMessage` and passes a `dmReadState: Record<conversationKey, ISO timestamp>` prop to `TimelineClient`.
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — `MessagesTab` is now a controlled component (read state + handlers passed in). New `NewMessageModal` component holds the picker + compose UI. `DirectMessageItem` interface gains `deliveredAt` and `deliveryError`. The localStorage helpers (`READ_TIMESTAMPS_KEY`, `getReadTimestamps`, `markConversationRead`) are removed; the unread-count tab badge now uses the same `buildConversations()` helper as the tab body so the two can't drift.

### Notes for upgraders
- Run `npx prisma db push` before restarting the server, otherwise the timeline page will 500 on the new `DmConversationRead` query.
- Existing localStorage read state is dropped — on first load after the upgrade, all conversations look unread until the user clicks into them or hits **Mark all read**. There is no migration of prior client-side state to the server (it would have been per-browser and incomplete).

## 0.1.14 (2026-05-12)

### Added
- **Unified Bluesky + Fediverse followers/following in the admin Timeline.** The header counts beside the **+ Compose** button (`src/app/timeline/page.tsx`) now show the combined total across both networks. The **Followers** and **Following** tabs render a single merged list sorted by `createdAt` desc, with a small `bsky` pill on Bluesky rows; profile links route to `https://bsky.app/profile/{handle}` for Bluesky entries. Each tab gains a **Sync Bluesky** button that pulls the live graph from the AT Protocol (`getFollowers` + `getFollows`, paginated 100/page) and reconciles it into the local DB — rows whose DID is not seen during sync are deleted so unfollows propagate. **Follow Back** on a Bluesky follower not yet in the following list creates a real `app.bsky.graph.follow` record. **Unfollow** on a Bluesky following row calls `agent.deleteFollow()` against the stored follow-record URI. The Follow form in the Following tab now accepts either a Fediverse handle (`@user@domain`) or a Bluesky handle/DID (`name.bsky.social`, `did:plc:...`) — handler classifies via a `@user@host.tld` regex and routes to the right backend action. Empty-state copy in the Followers tab now uses `siteConfig.fediAddress` instead of a hardcoded handle (a stray personal handle had been carried over in past releases; sanitized in this release).
- **Daily scheduled Bluesky sync.** New `scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` runs `syncBlueskyGraph()` and `pollBlueskyDMs()` once and exits. Intended to be wired up as a PM2 cron entry — script header documents the `pm2 start ... --cron-restart "0 3 * * *" --no-autorestart` invocation — or via system crontab. Manual one-shot: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts`. Not auto-installed; operators run the `pm2 start` command once on the host (then `pm2 save`).

### Fixed
- **Bluesky chat (DM) endpoints now use the required proxy header.** `pollBlueskyDMs()` (`src/lib/bluesky-dm-poll.ts`) and the `bsky_dm_reply` admin action (`src/app/api/admin/route.ts`) were calling `agent.api.chat.bsky.convo.*` against `bsky.social` directly, which returns HTTP 501 `MethodNotImplemented`. Both now route via `agent.withProxy("bsky_chat", "did:web:api.bsky.chat")`. Without this, the manual "Poll Bluesky" button and outgoing Bluesky DM replies were silently broken — verified by reproducing the 501 from a standalone runner. The same fix lets `scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` actually pull DMs.

### Schema
- Two new Prisma models: `BlueskyFollower` and `BlueskyFollowing` (the latter carries a nullable `followUri` for the AT URI of our follow record, required to call `deleteFollow`). Apply with `npx prisma db push`. Existing tables are untouched.

### Files
- New `src/lib/bluesky-graph.ts` — `syncBlueskyGraph()` paginates `getFollowers` / `getFollows` and reconciles the local mirrors with prune-on-miss; `followBlueskyAccount()` / `unfollowBlueskyAccount()` create and undo follow records, persisting the AT URI returned from `agent.follow()`; `resolveBlueskyActor()` turns a handle (or DID) into a DID via `agent.resolveHandle`.
- New `scripts/scheduled-bluesky-sync.ts` — standalone tsx script for cron use.
- `src/app/api/admin/route.ts` — three new actions: `sync_bluesky_graph`, `bsky_follow` (accepts `did` or `handleOrDid`), `bsky_unfollow` (by local `followingId`, returns 422 if the row lacks `followUri`). DM-reply proxy header fix in the `bsky_dm_reply` branch.
- `src/lib/bluesky-dm-poll.ts` — chat-service proxy header on `listConvos` / `getMessages`.
- `src/app/timeline/page.tsx` — loads `blueskyFollower` / `blueskyFollowing` alongside the Fedi tables, builds discriminated-union merged arrays sorted by `createdAt` desc, derives `totalFollowerCount` / `totalFollowingCount` for the header, and passes `siteConfig.fediAddress` through to the client.
- `src/app/timeline/TimelineClient.tsx` — `FollowerItem` / `FollowingItem` are now `{ source: "fedi" } | { source: "bsky" }` unions; both tab renderers branch on `source` for the identity row, profile link, Follow Back / Unfollow targets, and Sync Bluesky button. The Follow form's submit handler detects `@user@domain` via regex and falls back to `bsky_follow` otherwise. Accepts a new `fediAddress` prop used in the empty-state copy.

## 0.1.13 (2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **New installs would never create database tables.** `install.sh`, the Dockerfile, the README, and the deployment docs all ran `npx prisma migrate deploy` — but FediHome doesn't track migration files (no `prisma/migrations/` directory). With nothing to deploy, `migrate deploy` exited cleanly without creating any tables, so a fresh `curl install.sh | bash` produced an app that crashed the moment it tried to query Postgres. Verified with the actual Prisma CLI: against an empty `prisma/migrations/` it prints *"No migration found in prisma/migrations / No pending migrations to apply"* and creates zero tables.
- Switched `install.sh`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the relevant `docs/*.md` to `npx prisma db push`, which is what the project's no-migrations workflow actually requires. `db push` reads `prisma/schema.prisma` directly and creates/updates tables to match. Prisma refuses any push that would drop data unless you pass `--accept-data-loss`, so it's also safe to run on existing production databases when upgrading.
- **Dockerfile**: container now runs `npx prisma db push --skip-generate` at startup before launching the server, so the schema is synced against whatever database `DATABASE_URL` points at — first install or upgrade. The Prisma CLI is now copied into the runner stage (was builder-only) for this purpose.

### Notes for upgraders
- Existing operators don't need to do anything — your DB already has the tables. Future `git pull && npx prisma db push && npm run build && pm2 restart fedihome` upgrade flow remains unchanged.
- Contributors changing `prisma/schema.prisma`: run `npx prisma db push` (no `migrate dev`) and document the change under a "Schema" heading in the changelog.

## 0.1.12 (2026-05-11)

### Added
- **Author follow-ups on microblog posts.** From your own post detail page, an admin-only "Add follow-up" button lets you compose a threaded reply that cross-posts to Bluesky as a real reply (uses `reply.root` and `reply.parent` against the original's stored AT URI, with thread-root resolution if the parent is itself a reply) and federates as an ActivityPub Note with `inReplyTo` set to the parent's `apId`. Follow-ups become first-class `Post` rows with their own slug, permalink, and federation, but are hidden from the homepage feed, journal, articles, RSS, XML-RPC, and profile post counts — they appear inline on the original post's page as author-styled comment cards (uses `siteConfig.authorName` and `siteConfig.avatarPath`) with a "View follow-up thread →" link, and a "↩ in reply to [original]" header at the top of any follow-up's permalink. Threads/DayOne are skipped for follow-ups (no useful threading model). Replies-to-incoming-comments still stay platform-local (existing behavior unchanged). UI is gated to top-level posts in v1; the data model already supports chained follow-ups.

### Schema
- New self-referential FK on `Post`: `inReplyToPostId` (nullable) → `Post.id`, with reverse relations `inReplyTo` / `followUps` and an index on `inReplyToPostId`. Apply with `npx prisma db push`. Existing rows get `NULL`.

### Files
- New `src/lib/crosspost.ts:crosspostReplyToBluesky()` — resolves the parent CID via `agent.getPost`, walks up to the thread root if the parent is itself a reply, then calls `agent.post` with the proper `reply.root` / `reply.parent` refs. Shares text-truncation / embed-building with the existing `crosspostToBluesky` (extracted into a private `truncateForBluesky` helper).
- New `src/components/fedi/AuthorFollowUpForm.tsx` — small client form (textarea + 300-char counter + submit) that POSTs `{ content, inReplyToPostId }` to `/api/compose` and refreshes on success.
- `src/app/api/compose/route.ts` — accepts optional `inReplyToPostId`; routes Bluesky to the threaded helper when the parent has a `blueskyUri`; sets `inReplyTo: parent.apId` on the federated AP `Create` activity; gates Threads/DayOne to top-level only.
- `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` — fetches `followUps` and `inReplyTo`; renders follow-ups inline; renders the in-reply-to header; mounts the form when `isAdmin && !post.inReplyToPostId`.
- `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/journal/page.tsx`, `src/app/articles/page.tsx`, `src/app/feed.xml/route.ts`, `src/app/users/[username]/page.tsx`, `src/app/xmlrpc/route.ts` — listing queries filtered with `inReplyToPostId: null` so follow-ups don't clutter feeds.
- `src/app/ap/outbox/route.ts`, `src/app/ap/post/[slug]/route.ts` — emit `inReplyTo` in the AP object so other servers thread follow-ups correctly.

## 0.1.11 (2026-05-10)

### Security
This release applies the cross-portable findings from a deep security audit run against the sister project samuellison-web on 2026-05-10. (Findings tagged H4/H6/C4/C5/H7 from the previous fedihome audit were already fixed.)

#### Critical
- **AP inbox SSRF.** `verifyIncomingSignature`, `fetchActorInfo`, and `handleBoost`'s remote-post fetch now reject URLs whose hostname is in private/loopback/CGNAT/link-local space — and additionally DNS-resolve to defeat rebinding. New `src/lib/url-guard.ts` exports `isPrivateUrl` (public, with decimal/hex/octal IPv4 + IPv6 ULA + link-local + v4-mapped) and an async `assertPublicHost` for trust-boundary fetches.
- **HTML sanitizer entity bypass.** `src/lib/sanitize.ts` now decodes HTML entities before checking dangerous URI schemes, so `&#x6a;avascript:alert(1)` no longer slips through to federated content rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Also strips `<iframe>` and catches self-closing `<script/>`/`<style/>`.

#### High
- **`image/svg+xml` removed** from the `/uploads/[...path]` MIME map. The route no longer serves uploaded SVGs (XSS-prone when navigated directly).
- **CSP hardening.** Dropped `'unsafe-eval'` from `script-src`. Added `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `object-src 'none'`/`base-uri 'self'`/`form-action 'self'`. New per-route `/uploads/*` header (`default-src 'none'; sandbox`) so any payload that slips media validation can't execute scripts.
- **XML-RPC brute force.** `/xmlrpc` no longer accepts `ADMIN_SECRET` as the password — Micropub bearer tokens only — and is now per-bucket rate-limited (10 attempts / 60s, same `TRUSTED_PROXY` model as the admin login route).

#### Medium
- **CSRF on guest endpoints.** `verifyOrigin` is now applied to `/api/comments` and `/api/kudos`.
- **Bluesky thumbnail fetch SSRF.** `crosspostToBluesky`'s video link-card path rejects private/internal `thumbnailUrl`s and adds a 10s timeout.
- **XML-RPC content & XML injection.** Post titles and IDs are XML-escaped on output; CDATA-wrapped content has internal `]]>` split to prevent CDATA termination.
- **`verifyOrigin` protocol check.** Validates protocol in addition to hostname.

#### Low / hygiene
- `<script>`/`<style>` strip regex extended to catch self-closing variants.
- Middleware uses `pathname.slice` instead of `pathname.replace`.
- Removed unused `isAdminRequest` helper from `src/lib/auth.ts`.
- Added `/.well-known/security.txt` template (replace email before deploying).

### Notes for forks
- This release does **not** introduce the DB-backed session-token model from samuellison-web. FediHome's existing per-login HMAC-bound cookie (added in a prior release) is functionally equivalent for the H4 finding. Operators wanting the DB-session approach should adapt from samuellison-web v0.4.0.

## 0.1.10 (2026-05-10)

### Fixed
- **Bluesky video crossposts** now render as a tappable rich link card instead of a broken/missing preview. PeerTube/MakerTube thumbnails are fetched, uploaded as a blob, and attached as `app.bsky.embed.external` (uri + title + description + thumb). Posts with photos still use the existing `app.bsky.embed.images` path; posts with both photos and a video keep the photos embed and append the video URL inline. Threads/DayOne crossposts unchanged.
- **Mobile menu drift** — `MobileMenu.tsx` was missing "Videos" and "Audio" entries (added in 0.1.9 to the desktop navbar) and still listed a stale "Store" item that never existed in FediHome. Both menus now read from a shared `src/lib/nav.ts` config to prevent future drift.

### Changed
- Home page intro now also links to Videos and Audio (in addition to About Me and Photography). Row uses `flex-wrap` so it tidies on mobile.

## 0.1.9 (2026-05-09)

### Added
- **Video section** at `/videos` — embed PeerTube videos in posts. Paste a URL in compose, the system fetches title + thumbnail via PeerTube oEmbed. Federation includes the video URL so Mastodon shows a link preview. Allowlist of trusted PeerTube hosts (makertube.net, framatube.org, tilvids.com, etc.) — extend in `src/lib/peertube.ts`.
- **Audio section** at `/audio` — upload MP3s with automatic duration detection. Native HTML5 audio player. Dedicated `/audio/[slug]` page. Hero slider for featured tracks.
- **Podcast RSS feed** at `/audio/feed.xml` — RSS 2.0 + iTunes namespace, ready for any podcast app. Configure title/author/cover via `PODCAST_TITLE`, `PODCAST_AUTHOR`, `PODCAST_DESCRIPTION`, `PODCAST_EMAIL`, `PODCAST_IMAGE` env vars.
- **Compose post types** — `+ Add video` (URL modal with oEmbed preview) and `+ Add audio` (MP3 upload, max 100MB). "Add to Videos" and "Add to Audio" toggles.
- **HTTP Range request support** in the `/uploads/[...path]` route — needed for audio scrubbing.
- ActivityPub federation: outgoing posts with audio attach a `Document` with `mediaType: audio/mpeg`; posts with videos include the URL in content.

### Schema
- New `Video` model
- New `Audio` model
- `Post` extended with `videos[]`, `videoTitles[]`, `audioPaths[]`, `audioTitles[]`, `audioCovers[]` arrays

### New dependencies
- `music-metadata` — reads MP3 duration without needing ffmpeg

### Other
- Navbar gains "Videos" and "Audio" links

## 0.1.8 (2026-05-09)

### Security
- Fix HIGH severity Fedify CVE [GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp) — resource exhaustion via unbounded HTTP redirects (Fedify 2.0.6 → 2.2.0)

### Added
- **Service update monitor** — `npm run check-updates` script reads `npm outdated`, `npm audit`, and GitHub release feeds for a curated watchlist (Fedify, Next.js, Prisma, atproto, React); findings appear in the notification bell under a new "Updates" category with dismiss/apply actions
- **Hero slider** on `/photography` — opt-in via `Photo.hero` flag (disabled by default); 16:7 auto-advancing carousel with dot + arrow + swipe nav, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **`MaintenanceItem` model** + key-value `SiteSetting` model already added in 0.1.7 now powers maintenance read state
- **Photo dimension columns** (`width`, `height`) backfilled via `sharp` — required for masonry layout
- **Lightbox bottom action bar** — optional "View post" link surfaces detail-page comments/EXIF without forcing a full nav

### Changed
- **Photography grid switched from forced 1:1 uniform crop to true masonry** via `react-masonry-css` — portraits stay portrait, landscapes stay landscape, mixed orientations render at native aspect ratio
- Photo click now opens a fullscreen Lightbox with arrow/keyboard/swipe nav across the entire portfolio (no longer routes to the blog post)
- Notification API includes maintenance items as a new `update` type with wrench icon and amber accent
